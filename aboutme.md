Traveled solo trip 17 countries, have tried paragliding, skydiving and hot air ballooning, and found that I like paragliding the most. I plan to get a paragliding license when I have time. (Fly independently!)


### My story
Born and raised in Shanghai, China. After graduating from middle school, followed my parents to Canada and completed my high school and undergraduate there.
