## Summary:
I develop a 2048 Game using Python. Users can use arrow keys to manipulate the numbers to merge them.

I learn how to manage a 2D game grid, detect valid moves, implement tile-combination logic, and update the board state accordingly after each action.

The most challenging part was designing the movement logic to simulate how numbers shift and merge according to game rules, especially ensuring that tiles merge only once per move through debugging and iterative refinement.

## Project description: 
Use arrow keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí) to merge the same numbers make it get larger
