## Summary:
I build a real-time weather warning system that fetches live weather data and sends out alerts when severe weather is detected.

And I learn how to integrate a public API, set up a backend with FastAPI, and create a responsive frontend with React. I also learn how to handle asynchronous data fetching and error handling in real-world situations.

I find the most challenging part is ensuring reliable communication between the frontend and backend, especially handling CORS issues, which I solve through careful debugging and configuration of middleware.
