## Project description: 
A simple and efficient Todo List application to help users manage their daily tasks, supporting task adding, completion marking and deleting functions.

## Summary:
I build a simple To-Do List Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I think in terms of DOM manipulation, event handling, and application state management without relying on any frontend frameworks. I learn how to use the API to ensure tasks are preserved even after refreshing the page.

I don't find any challenging parts in this project.

## Function:
‚úÖ Add a new task

‚úîÔ∏è Mark task as completed

üóëÔ∏è Delete a task

üìù Local storage (tasks not lost after refresh)
