## Startup company - Software Engineer (Recent)
As a developer of the startup team, I built the backend system architecture and participated in the pricing strategy formulation of the business model. 

In an environment with limited resources, I quickly mastered the distributed system design and cloud-native architecture, and accumulated full-process experience from data cleaning to model deployment by building a scalable machine learning pipeline to process massive data sets. This high-pressure growth experience has enabled me to quickly learn and deliver production-level systems.

## Varicent - Software Quality Assurance 
Quickly get started with Jira/Bugzilla/TestTrack and other testing tool chains in the AWS environment, and independently completed the construction of a portal website automation test system for 20,000+ users within two weeks. 

Through the compatibility test solution across more than 10 platforms and devices, the test efficiency is increased by 60%. This experience gave me a deep understanding of how to transform test theory into a practical solution to ensure the stability of large systems.

## Cognitive Linguistics Lab at the University of Waterloo - Front-end Engineer 
Based on research needs, I mastered the AngularJS/React front-end framework independently and built a large academic platform using modular design. I also participated in Node.js/Django back-end development. 

Through Docker container deployment and SQL query optimization, I went through the full life cycle development process from demand analysis to online delivery.

## Honkon Group - Software Engineer  
Starting from self-learning RESTful specifications, the developed API successfully supported 5000+ concurrent requests. I led the reconstruction of the legacy JavaScript system, which increased the page loading speed by 40%, and saved the company $1,500 per month by fixing data analysis vulnerabilities, which was the first time to verify the direct impact of technical optimization on business value.
